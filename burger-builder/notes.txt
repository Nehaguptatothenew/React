CONFIGURATIONS:-
run npm install --save redux react-redux
make a store folder.
wrap the index.js in a <Provider>

how it works:
1.After dispathing the action from the burgerBuilderComponent it will first go to the action creator
2.Then follwed by that it will go to the reducer
3.Reducer will then update the value
4.we will get the updated value back in the component by the help of subscriber i.e. mapStateToProps

AUTHENTICATION:-
For burgerBuilder we will grant the the access to everyone
for orders we will grant it to only authenticated users.
we can do so by goinf to the firebase and setting up the rules like this.
{
  "rules": {
    "ingredients":{
      ".read": true,
    ".write": true
    },
      "orders":{
        ".read":"auth!=null",
          ".write":"auth!=null"
      }
    
  }
}

How to use the downloaded files

1) Run "npm install" in the extracted folder
2) Run "npm start" to view the project

Compare my code to yours to solve issues you might encounter. You may also copy the content of src/ into your own project's src/ folder to use your project setup (which might've been created with a different create-react-app version) and still use my code.

We will use thunk here as a third party middleware which we will export.
It will help us in asynchronous code 
It allows our actioncreater to not return an action.
Rather return a function which will eventually dispatch an action.

actioncreater can run async code.
reducer on the other hand runs only pure synchronous code.(it is used basically for state manangement)
So this is the reason middleware is used between dispatcher and reducer.

Store folder in our project contains the redux part.
action are pure function qki usme koi logic nhi hota and neither we manipulate .We just pass values.
Behind the scene redux always create a new copy of the object.

for deep cloning of ibjects we can refer to the redux official page
